            <p>The building formation is based on a dance movement of "TANGO". Building forms as stage and each window represents a dance. Each building has their unique position and direction. The balconies also transform with their buildings. During the day, they act as a dance of TANGO and at the night, they transform into Chinese Laterns and shines upon the courtyard with various colors.</p>
