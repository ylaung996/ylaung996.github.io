            <p>Hello, My name is Ye Lin Aung. I am an Architecture and Graphic Design student at Roger Williams University who was born and raised in Rangoon, Myanmar in South East Asia region.</p>
            
            <p>Since architects in my country are not being recognized and people do not know what architecture is about, most of the buildings in my country are designed by enginers without any architectural practice and layout. As the result, most of the buildings in my country turn out to be formless and inorganized.</p>
            
            <p>In order to know more about architecture and design, I came to United State during 2014 to seek the Bachelor of Architecture and hope to bring these knowledges back to my country to achieve it.</p>
